\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Bayesian statistics involves updating prior beliefs with data. Starting from the prior $f(\bm {\theta }|C)$, we find the likelihood $L(\bm {\theta };\bm {y},C)$and ``combine'' them to give our posterior $f(\bm {y}|\bm {\theta },C)$, which is a distribution that gives us information about $\bm {\theta }$ with higher confidence. \textbf {I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DRAW THIS PROPERLY, ALSO MY LIKELIHOOD IS THE WRONG WAY ROUND}\relax }}{5}
